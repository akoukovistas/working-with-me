# Working with me!
One of the most important things when joining a new team, or working with a new contractor is determining if they are a good cultural match for you, and your existing team. This can be quite difficult to get right and in a world full of people behind a screen all across the globe, even harder sometimes. 

While I don't believe in formulazing human communication and connections, you can refer to this as a playbook detailing me as a professional. It is an attempt to document how it is working with me, my values, my working style, my priorities, management style, pitfalls and even an FAQ section for your reading pleasure!

## My key values
### People over projects.
I care about the people I am working with. Even if we have our disagreements over work matters, you hate my jokes, coding style, or you are a T'au player; I still care about you. I value and try to foster a working environment where everyone goes home without any unnecessary grief and stress. 

This means that if a team member is stuck or struggling, I will drop whatever I can to help. Be it with coding a solution, designing a system, having a shitty day, or what have you.

This doesn't mean that I will happily miss deadlines and avoid work. Consider that a fully working team is more productive than me focusing solely on my work while someone is stuck on a task for three days.

### The "Don't let me fail" principle

### Mutual respect.
I respect you and I believe you are doing what you are doing because you are good at it. I highly appreciate when this is understood by both sides. 

Please understand that the majority of my day to day work is solving logic puzzles, reviewing existing solutions and optimizing them, and talking about tech. If I am asking questions, or challenging something, it's because I want things to be done as good as they can, and/or learn more about what is happening.

Respect, similar to trust, is earned and once damaged, it's hard to recover. I will do my best to raise any issues if/when I feel direspected, being lied to, or similar. I appreciate when people do the same.

### Open, direct, communication.
I know how to be diplomatic, passive aggressive, cryptic, manipulative, aggressive, and how to go "by the book". That being said, I strongly prefer being as direct and open as possible with the people I am expected to spend a good chunk of my week with.

I highly value direct and timely feedback, getting straight to the point and being kept in the loop about things.
